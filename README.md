As the DCA's Getty Marrow Digital Archive Assistant this summer, I worked on prototyping an online image repository on Airtable. The code that I used to scrape, clean, and manipulate data to populate the Airtable is included here. Much of the work involved in this project was carried out using command line and Python. 



**Digitization:**

Images should be high quality TIFF files with a minimum 300 dpi. For the sake of preservation and for future copies, all file uploads on Airtable should meet these standards. 

Images must be delivered by vendor via USB stick or hard drive in order to maintain fie integrity. 

File naming must follow naming convention. Naming convention is as follows: first initial, last name, number of artwork (assigned based on timeline of entry, i.e. 001 for the earliest entry).

**Cataloging & descriptive information:**
