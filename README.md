As the DCA's Getty Marrow Digital Archive Assistant this summer, I worked on prototyping an online image repository on Airtable. The code that I used to scrape, clean, and manipulate data to populate the Airtable is included here. Much of the work involved in this project was carried out using command line and Python.
